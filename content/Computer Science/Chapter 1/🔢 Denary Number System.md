Denary (decimal) is the everyday number system humans use — base 10.

---

## Basics

- Digits from 0 to 9.
- Each digit represents powers of 10, starting from right to left.

---

### Column Headings (5-digit example):

|10000|1000|100|10|1|
|-|-|-|-|-|

---

## Common Mistake

>⚠️ The digit '10' is not part of denary digits — digits only range `0–9`.

---

### Example: Denary Number 4392

4 × 1000 + 3 × 100 + 9 × 10 + 2 × 1 = **4392**

---

### Why Denary?

- Familiar to humans.
- The base for all counting in everyday life.

---

>📝 **Note**: Denary is rarely used in computing internally, but conversions to/from denary are vital for humans to understand computer data.
