## Why Movement is Important ⚠️

- Cells need to take in nutrients and oxygen.
- Remove waste products like carbon dioxide and urea.
- Maintain internal balance (homeostasis).

---

## Diffusion 🔁

- Movement of molecules from **high to low concentration** until evenly spread.
- Does not require energy (passive).
- Example: Oxygen moving into cells.

---

## Factors Affecting Diffusion 🌡️

- Concentration gradient (steeper → faster diffusion).
- Temperature (higher → faster diffusion).
- Surface area (larger → faster diffusion).
- Distance (shorter → faster diffusion).

---

## Osmosis 💧

- Special case of diffusion for water molecules.
- Movement of water from **dilute (high water potential) to concentrated solution (low water potential)** through a semi-permeable membrane.

---

### Water Potential 📊

- Measure of tendency of water to move.
- Pure water has the highest water potential (0).
- Solutes lower water potential.

---

## Active Transport ⚡

- Movement of substances from **low to high concentration** against the concentration gradient.
- Requires energy (ATP).
- Used in root hair cells to absorb minerals.

---

## Practical Example: Osmosis in Potato Tubes 🥔

- Place potato cylinders in different sugar solutions.
- Measure change in length or mass.
- Water moves by osmosis causing swelling or shrinking.

---

>📝 **Notes:**

- Diffusion and osmosis are passive processes.
- Active transport requires cellular respiration energy.

---

>⚠️ **Warning:**

- Do not confuse osmosis with diffusion; osmosis is specific to water.
- Cell membranes are selectively permeable, allowing some substances through but not others.

---

>✅ **Good to Know:**

- Surface area to volume ratio is important in cells for efficient diffusion.
- Adaptations like root hairs increase surface area for absorption.
