## Levels of Organisation 📏

Living organisms are organised from simple to complex:

1. **Cells** – basic unit of life.
2. **Tissues** – groups of similar cells working together.
3. **Organs** – groups of tissues performing specific functions.
4. **Organ systems** – groups of organs working together.
5. **Organism** – whole living thing.

## Cell Types 🧬

- **Prokaryotic cells:** Simple, no nucleus (e.g., bacteria).
- **Eukaryotic cells:** Complex, nucleus present (plants, animals).

## Plant Cells vs Animal Cells 🌱🐾

| Structure           | Plant Cell                   | Animal Cell              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Cell wall           | Present (cellulose)          | Absent                  |
| Chloroplasts        | Present                     | Absent                  |
| Vacuole             | Large permanent vacuole     | Small or absent         |
| Shape               | Fixed, rectangular          | Irregular                |

### Key Organelles and Their Functions ⚙️

| Organelle        | Function                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Nucleus          | Controls cell activities, contains DNA  |
| Cytoplasm        | Site of chemical reactions               |
| Cell membrane    | Controls movement in/out of cell         |
| Mitochondria     | Site of aerobic respiration               |
| Ribosomes        | Protein synthesis                        |
| Chloroplasts     | Photosynthesis (plants only)             |
| Cell wall        | Provides strength and support (plants)  |
| Vacuole          | Storage of water and nutrients           |

>💡 **Tip:** Use a microscope to identify plant vs animal cells in samples.

## Specialized Cells (Examples) 🧑‍🔬

| Cell Type          | Adaptation                          | Function                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Red blood cells    | Biconcave shape, no nucleus       | Transport oxygen                 |
| Sperm cells        | Flagellum (tail), streamlined     | Fertilisation                   |
| Root hair cells    | Long extensions                   | Absorb water and minerals       |
| Nerve cells        | Long axons, dendrites             | Transmit electrical impulses    |

>📝 **Notes:**

- Cells with similar functions form tissues.
- Different tissues form organs, e.g., heart, leaves.

---

>⚠️ **Warning:**

- Plant cells have cellulose walls, animal cells do not.
- Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain their own DNA.

---

>✅ **Good to Know:**

- Mitochondria are often called the “powerhouse of the cell” because they produce ATP.
- Some single-celled organisms carry out all life processes in one cell.
