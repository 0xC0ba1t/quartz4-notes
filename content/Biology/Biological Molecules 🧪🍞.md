## Introduction

Living organisms are made of different molecules essential for life processes.

---

## Carbohydrates 🍚

- Made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen (C, H, O).
- Main source of energy.
- Examples:
  - **Monosaccharides:** glucose, fructose.
  - **Disaccharides:** sucrose, maltose.
  - **Polysaccharides:** starch, glycogen, cellulose.

---

### Test for Starch 🧫

- Use iodine solution.
- Blue-black colour indicates starch presence.

---

## Proteins 🥚

- Made of amino acids.
- Used for growth, repair, enzymes, hormones.
- Example: enzymes, antibodies.

---

## Lipids (Fats and Oils) 🧈

- Made of glycerol and fatty acids.
- Energy storage, insulation, cell membranes.

---

### Test for Lipids 🔬

- Emulsion test: add ethanol and water, cloudy white emulsion indicates lipids.

---

## Enzymes (Introduction) ⚗️

- Biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions.
- Made of proteins.
- Specific to substrate and reaction.

---

### Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity 🌡️

- Temperature
- pH
- Substrate concentration

---

>📝 **Notes:**

- Polysaccharides are energy storage (starch in plants, glycogen in animals).
- Cellulose provides structural support in plant cell walls.

---

>⚠️ **Warning:**

- Denaturation: extreme temperature or pH can change enzyme shape, stopping function.

---

>✅ **Good to Know:**

- Enzymes lower activation energy of reactions.
- All biological molecules are essential for cell structure and metabolism.
