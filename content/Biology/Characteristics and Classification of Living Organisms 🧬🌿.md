## What is Life? 🌟

Living organisms share several key characteristics:

- **Movement:** Ability to change position or move parts of the body.
- **Respiration:** Chemical reactions releasing energy from food.
- **Sensitivity:** Responding to stimuli from the environment.
- **Growth:** Increase in size and mass.
- **Reproduction:** Producing offspring.
- **Excretion:** Removal of metabolic wastes.
- **Nutrition:** Taking in and using nutrients.

>📝 **Note:** These characteristics can be remembered with the mnemonic **MR S GREN**.

## Classification of Living Organisms 🦠🌱🐾

To study the vast variety of life, organisms are grouped based on shared characteristics.

---

### The Five Kingdoms 👑

| Kingdom      | Characteristics                                              | Examples                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Monera       | Unicellular, prokaryotic, no nucleus                         | Bacteria                        |
| Protista     | Unicellular or simple multicellular, eukaryotic              | Amoeba, algae                  |
| Fungi        | Multicellular, eukaryotic, absorb nutrients from dead matter | Mushrooms, yeast               |
| Plantae      | Multicellular, eukaryotic, photosynthetic                    | Ferns, flowering plants        |
| Animalia     | Multicellular, eukaryotic, consume other organisms           | Mammals, insects, fish         |

### Why classify? 🤔

- Makes study easier.
- Shows evolutionary relationships.
- Helps identify organisms.

---

### Domains (Modern Classification) 🌐

- **Bacteria** (prokaryotes)
- **Archaea** (prokaryotes, often extreme environments)
- **Eukarya** (all eukaryotic organisms — plants, animals, fungi, protists)

---

### Binomial Nomenclature ✍️

- Two-part Latin names: *Genus species*  
- E.g., *Homo sapiens*, *Felis catus*

>💡 **Tip:** Genus is capitalized; species is lowercase and italicized.

---

>📝 **Notes:**

- Classification is hierarchical: Kingdom → Phylum → Class → Order → Family → Genus → Species.
- Species: group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring.

---

>⚠️ **Warning:**

- Similar appearances don’t always mean close relation.
- New genetic data can change classification.

---

>✅ **Good to Know:**

- Viruses are not classified as living organisms because they do not exhibit all MR S GREN characteristics independently.
