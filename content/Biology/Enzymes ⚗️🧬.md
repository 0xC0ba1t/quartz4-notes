## What are Enzymes? 🔥

- Biological catalysts made of proteins.
- Speed up chemical reactions without being used up.

---

## How Enzymes Work 🧩

- Substrate binds to enzyme’s **active site**.
- Enzyme-substrate complex forms.
- Product(s) released; enzyme remains unchanged.

---

## Enzyme Specificity 🔑

- Enzymes are specific to substrates (lock and key model).
- Induced fit model: enzyme changes shape slightly to fit substrate.

## Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity 📈

| Factor              | Effect                                                   |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Temperature         | Activity increases to optimum (~37°C), then denatures.  |
| pH                  | Each enzyme has optimum pH. Extreme pH denatures enzyme. |
| Substrate conc.     | Activity increases with more substrate until saturation.|
| Enzyme conc.        | More enzyme → more activity, if substrate is available. |

---

## Denaturation ❌

- Permanent change in enzyme structure.
- Active site shape changes → no substrate binding.

---

## Practical: Investigating Enzyme Activity 🔬

- Use amylase to break down starch.
- Test starch presence over time with iodine.
- Vary temperature or pH to see effect.

---

>📝 **Notes:**

- Enzymes are vital in digestion, respiration, photosynthesis.
- They help maintain life processes efficiently.

---

>⚠️ **Warning:**

- High temperatures or incorrect pH can irreversibly denature enzymes.

---

>✅ **Good to Know:**

- Enzymes lower activation energy and speed up reactions by billions of times.
- Cofactors and inhibitors can affect enzyme activity.
